Rock, Paper, Scissor.

<del>This is, for now, the console version of Rock, Paper, scissor, made for The Odin Project.</del>

Finished UI version of the game (:

To play this, just clone the project, open the index.html, <del>open de console and the game will run there.</del> and have fun!

If you prefere to play the live version, just access https://leoc01.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

That's it for now!

Have to implement the option to play just with the keyboard.
