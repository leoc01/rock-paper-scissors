Rock, Paper, Scissor.

<del>This is, for now, the console version of Rock, Paper, scissor, made for The Odin Project.</del>

Finished UI version of the game (:

To play this, just clone the project, open the index.html, <del>open de console and the game will run there.</del> and have fun!

If you prefere to play the live version, just access https://leoc01.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

The first goal of this project was to start to learn Javascript. For that I code a console version of rock-paper-scissors.

After that I put a UI in the game to understand better how Javascript code send informations to the browser and change the visual and text adding and removing classes, changing the styles in the user interface.

That's it for now!
